# Week 2 Lab Report

This lab report will contain a tutorial about how to log in to a course-specific account on `ieng6`. 

1. Installing VScode

The first step is to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

After installing and opening VScode, my screen looked like this:

While some differences may exist, everybody's starting page shou.d look relatively the same. 

2. Remotely Connecting

I first looked up my course-specific account here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Everybody's username should start with `cs15lsp22`, and it will be followd by three letters.

The first step I took to remotely connect to the server is opening a terminal in VScode:

I then typed the following command:

`ssh <my_account_name>@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

Since it is my first time logging in, it asked me to confirm my log-in. After clicking "yes," I entered in my password (will not be visible when entering). The following output was part of what should be visible if the password is entered correctly:

I am now connected remotely!
